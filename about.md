## Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello, and thanks for visiting my website!  
I'm **Jaehyung Choi**, but many people also know me as **Andrew**. I'm currently studying Engineering at the University of Cambridge, with a strong passion for embedded systems.

My interest in low-level programming began when I discovered the power of writing software at the register level. It stripped away the abstractions between hardware and software, making the inner workings feel less like magic and more like something I could truly understand and control.

In addition to embedded systems, I also have experience building applications and working across different layers of the tech stack. I'm most comfortable with **C** and **Python**, and I have some hands-on experience with **HTML** and **CSS** through web development projects.

I love learning new things and enjoy documenting my projects, ideas, and learning journey here. Feel free to explore and get to know more about my work!
