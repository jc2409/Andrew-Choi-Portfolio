# FIRST Tech Challenge UK Nationals 2025: Bigger, Better, and *Into the Deep*

Last week, a group of us from **Arm** swapped our usual desks for hi-vis vests and headed to London’s **Copper Box Arena** in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Our mission? To spend a volunteer day supporting the **2025 FIRST Tech Challenge UK Nationals**—and what a spectacle it was.

## What Is FIRST Tech Challenge?

**FIRST** is a charity that empowers students to design, build, and program robots, then pit them against one another in a series of escalating tournaments—regional events culminating in these Nationals. This season’s theme, **“Into the Deep,”** pushed teams to engineer robots capable of completing underwater-inspired tasks. The production value rivalled professional e-sports; every heat ran on time, and the atmosphere was electric.

## My Role: Field Inspector / FTA

I returned as a **Field Inspector / FTA**, ensure that every team and their robot can successfully compete in a match and solve any technical issues with robots on the field.

## Conversations That Matter

Between matches I always ask teams about life after school. It’s a stealth campaign to demystify apprenticeships and early-career routes in STEM. The answers this year were inspiring: aerospace dreams, biomedical ambitions, and quite a few budding roboticists. Their enthusiasm is contagious and a reminder of why volunteering matters.

## Highlights of the Day

- **Flawless Logistics** – FIRST Tech Challenge UK ran the entire program like clockwork—no small feat with dozens of teams and hundreds of parts.  
- **Innovation on Display** – From 3D-printed grippers to custom vision pipelines, the ingenuity level keeps rising.  
- **Community Spirit** – Spectators, mentors, and teams cheered each other on, proving competition and collaboration can coexist.

## Why You Should Volunteer

If you’re considering giving back, FIRST events are a masterclass in real-world engineering, teamwork, and youthful creativity. One day of your expertise can keep a robot—and a student’s confidence—on track.

## Final Thoughts

The **2025 Nationals** weren’t just bigger; they set a benchmark for what student-led engineering can achieve when supported by a passionate community. I left the Copper Box exhausted, inspired, and already counting down to next season.
