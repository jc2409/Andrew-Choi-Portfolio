## Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi there — thanks for stopping by!  
I'm **Jaehyung Choi**, though I'm also known as **Andrew**. I'm currently an Engineering student at the University of Cambridge, with a deep interest in **embedded systems** and low-level programming.

My passion for this field began when I first explored programming at the register level. Stripping away the layers between hardware and software gave me a sense of clarity and control — it was no longer just magic, but something tangible and understandable.

Beyond embedded systems, I’ve also worked on application development and have experience across various parts of the tech stack. My go-to languages are **C** and **Python**, and I’ve dabbled in **HTML** and **CSS** through web development projects.

I’m always eager to learn, build, and share. This site is a space where I document my projects, ideas, and the journey along the way.
