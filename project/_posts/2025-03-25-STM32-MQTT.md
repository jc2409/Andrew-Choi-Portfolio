# Running an MQTT Client on STM32L4 with ES-WiFi and Eclipse Paho

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to run an MQTT client on an STM32L4 development board (**B‑L475E‑IOT01A1**) using the integrated **ES‑WiFi** module. The objective was to connect the board to a public Mosquitto MQTT broker, subscribe to a topic, and publish messages periodically. For MQTT functionality, the **Eclipse Paho Embedded MQTT Client** library was integrated with the STM32's networking interface.

This post outlines the integration process, implementation highlights, and testing setup. It concludes with an optional configuration to connect the board to a cloud-hosted MQTT broker using an AWS EC2 instance.

## Features

* MQTT client implementation using Paho Embedded C library
* Wi‑Fi connectivity via ES‑WiFi module
* Hostname resolution and TCP socket communication
* Topic subscription and periodic message publishing
* Real-time debugging and verification via command-line tools

## Implementation Details

### 1. Integrating the MQTT Client Library

We used the **Eclipse Paho Embedded C client**, requiring the `MQTTClient` and `MQTTPacket` source files. These were placed under the project's middleware directory.

To resolve symbol conflicts with ST HAL headers (e.g., `SUCCESS`), we renamed the MQTT return code `SUCCESS` to `MQTT_SUCCESS`.

### 2. Network Interface Wrappers

The Paho library requires a custom `Network` structure that defines how data is read/written. We implemented:

* `mqtt_network_read()`
* `mqtt_network_write()`
* `mqtt_network_disconnect()`

These functions wrap calls to the ES‑WiFi interface provided by ST's BSP libraries.

### 3. Timer Abstraction

Paho's timer interface is used for keep-alive and timeouts. Our implementation leverages `HAL_GetTick()` to define:

* `TimerInit()`
* `TimerCountdownMS()`
* `TimerCountdown()`
* `TimerIsExpired()`
* `TimerLeftMS()`

### 4. Application Logic in `main.c`

#### Wi‑Fi Connection

The `wifi_connect()` function initializes the Wi‑Fi module, connects to an access point, and retrieves an IP address.

#### Broker Communication

1. Use `WIFI_GetHostAddress()` to resolve the broker hostname.
2. Connect using `WIFI_OpenClientConnection()`.
3. Initialize the MQTT client with the custom `Network` struct.
4. Configure the MQTT connection (client ID, keep-alive, clean session).
5. Subscribe to `sensor/data` and publish messages every second using `HAL_Delay(1000)` or FreeRTOS's `osDelay(1000)`.

## Testing and Debugging

### Tools and Environment

* **IDE**: Keil uVision5 (Arm Compiler 5)
* **Network**: Android Hotspot
* **Board**: B-L745E-IOT01A1
* **Terminal**: Tera Term @ 115200 baud
* **Verification Tool**: `mosquitto_sub`

### Example Command

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -t "sensor/data"
```

### Broker Setup (Optional)

To self-host a broker (non-TLS) on AWS EC2:

1. Launch a Ubuntu EC2 instance.
2. Install Mosquitto:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
   ```
3. Allow port 1883 in the EC2 security group.
4. Set your board's broker hostname to the EC2 public DNS.

## Key Modifications in Code

* Update Wi‑Fi SSID and password in `main.c`
* Change broker hostname if using a custom server
* Ensure Arm Compiler 5 is installed ([Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka005073/latest/))

## Conclusion

This project successfully showcases how to integrate an MQTT client on STM32 using the Paho library and ES-WiFi interface. It provides a foundational example for IoT applications where real-time data publishing is essential. While this setup doesn't use TLS, it lays the groundwork for more secure implementations in the future.
