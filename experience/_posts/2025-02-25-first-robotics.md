# Volunteering at FIRST Tech Challenge UK: Inspiring the Future of Robotics

## Introduction

This past weekend, I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer at the FIRST Tech Challenge UK, serving as both the Lead Field Inspector and FIRST Technical Advisor (FTA). It was an inspiring experience that reminded me why I’m passionate about robotics and STEM education. Being part of an event that empowers students to innovate, collaborate, and lead was nothing short of energizing.

## Role and Responsibilities

As the Lead Field Inspector, I was responsible for ensuring all competing robots met the event’s rigorous technical standards before taking the field. This involved detailed inspections of hardware, software compliance, and safety checks—making sure every team started on equal footing.

As FTA, I provided technical support and maintained the integrity of the field systems throughout the competition. From diagnosing connection issues to assisting teams with troubleshooting, it was a hands-on role that required quick thinking and deep technical knowledge.

## Event Highlights

What stood out most was the enthusiasm and resilience of the students. Teams demonstrated not only technical skill but also adaptability and sportsmanship. Watching their robots in action—some achieving complex autonomous tasks, others driven with incredible precision—was truly inspiring.

A standout moment for me was seeing a rookie team overcome early hardware failures to compete successfully later in the day. Their persistence and teamwork were remarkable and captured the spirit of the competition perfectly.

## What I Learned

Volunteering in this dual role sharpened my technical troubleshooting skills and deepened my appreciation for structured teamwork under pressure. I also gained a new perspective on how impactful mentorship and guidance can be for young engineers and programmers.

## Why Volunteering Matters

FIRST events are about more than just robotics. They foster creativity, build leadership, and teach real-world problem-solving. Volunteering allowed me to contribute to that mission, helping create a space where students could grow and shine.

Working alongside other dedicated volunteers also reinforced the importance of community in STEM. The event wouldn’t have been possible without the collective effort of organizers, mentors, and supporters.

## Looking Ahead

With the FIRST Tech Challenge Championship coming up in London this June, I’m more excited than ever to see these brilliant young minds push their projects to the next level. I look forward to continuing my involvement and supporting these future innovators.

## Conclusion

Volunteering at the FIRST Tech Challenge UK was an enriching experience that reaffirmed my belief in the power of education and innovation. It was a privilege to play a part in these students' journeys and I can’t wait to see what they accomplish next.

If you’re ever considering volunteering for a STEM event, I wholeheartedly recommend it. You’ll walk away inspired—and maybe even a little more hopeful for the future.
